Fake is a fake data generator for Go (Golang), heavily inspired by the forgery and ffaker Ruby gems.
This particular branch is a fork from [icrowley](https://github.com/icrowley/fake) with improvements merged from the community.


## About

Most data and methods are ported from forgery/ffaker Ruby gems.
For the list of available methods, please look at [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/syscrusher/fake).

Currently, English and Russian are available. English is the default.
If the selected language does not implement the required data, then English will be returned as a fallback.
This may be disabled by calling `EnFallback(false)`.

Fake stores the raw data in line-delimited files under data/, which is subdivided by language.
By default, fake uses a gzip'd representation of the filesystem generated by [mjibson/esc](https://github.com/mjibson/esc).
Embedding the data removes external file dependencies during runtime, and compression gives a small space gain. Decompressed files are cached after first access.

If the sample data is changed or new data is added, `data.go` must be regenerated.
If you are using Go >=1.4, then a simple `go generate` will handle it.
Otherwise, you must get [mjibson/esc](https://github.com/mjibson/esc) and run `esc -o data.go -pkg fake data`.

Fake can load the files directly from the filesystem by calling `UseExternalData(true)`.


## Examples

Basic data:
```go
name := fake.FirstName()
fullname := fake.FullName()
product := fake.Product()
```

Select non-English language:
```go
err := fake.SetLang("ru")
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
password := fake.SimplePassword()
```

Remove English fallback:
```go
err := fake.SetLang("ru")
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
fake.EnFallback(false)
password := fake.Paragraph() // returns a blank string because Paragraph() is not implemented in Russian
```

Use external data:
```go
fake.UseExternalData(true)
password := fake.Paragraph()
```
